Fixes:
------

- Fix exit code for non-cygwin process running in console. The bug
  was introduced in 3.5.0.

- Make the interface names handled by if_nametoindex() and if_indextoname()
  consistent with that of if_nameindex().

- Revert error handling for non-Cygwin child processes to use Cygwin's
  error mode by default.  Resetting the error mode to the OS default
  error mode is now possible by using the new CYGWIN environment variable
  option "winjitdebug".
